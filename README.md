# Dominion Energy Home Assistant Integration üîå‚ö°

A custom Home Assistant integration that grabs your Dominion Energy usage data and turns it into nice looking graphs and useful sensors.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha Software Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

This integration is a fun personal project that I built to scratch my own itch. There is no Dominion Energy API, that I have been able to find, so this integration uses a scraper to download the usage data. It WILL break if there are any significant changes to their website.

### What does that mean?

- It works! (on my machine‚Ñ¢)
- There might be bugs (definitely are bugs)
- Updates happen when I have time and feel like working on my Home Assistant server
- Breaking changes are not just possible, they're probable
- Support is best-effort

## Features

- Logs into Dominion Energy website
- Downloads your usage data (hopefully)
- Creates sensors for:
    - Daily energy usage
    - Weekly trends
    - Current billing period usage and costs (usually)
    - Adds energy data to the Energy Dashboard

## Installation
<details>
<summary>Manual Installation</summary>

1. Copy the `custom_components/dominion_energy` directory into your Home Assistant's `custom_components` folder
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Hope for the best! üé≤

> **Note**: When downloading files manually, use the `Raw` button on GitHub. Your browser's "Save As" might add unexpected formatting that will make Home Assistant very confused.
</details>

### Requirements

- Home Assistant 2025.1.0 or newer (it might work on older versions)
- A Dominion Energy account with online access
- A sense of adventure and patience for alpha software
- Chrome browser installed, the integration will attempt to install a headless version.

After installation, configure the integration through the UI:
1. Go to Settings -> Devices & Services
2. Click the "+ Add Integration" button
3. Search for "Dominion Energy"
4. Enter your Dominion Energy credentials
5. Cross your fingers and watch the magic happen! ‚ú®

### Updating

- **HACS users**: HACS will notify you of updates. Whether you should install them is another question entirely! üòÖ
- **Manual installation**: You'll need to repeat the manual installation steps. Consider this your opportunity to check the latest code changes before updating!

Remember: This is alpha software! Always check the release notes before updating, and maybe keep a backup of your working configuration. Just in case. üòâ

- This is a Kotlin programmer's Python code
